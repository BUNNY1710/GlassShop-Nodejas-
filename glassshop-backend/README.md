# GlassShop Backend - Node.js

This is the Node.js/Express backend for the GlassShop application, converted from Spring Boot.

## Features

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (ADMIN, STAFF)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- **RESTful API**: Complete API endpoints for all business operations
- **Security**: Password hashing with bcrypt, JWT token validation

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize ORM
- PostgreSQL
- JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- bcryptjs

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update `.env` with your database credentials:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=glass_shop
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRATION=24h

PORT=8080
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

- InvoiceItem
- Payment
- AuditLog
- Installation

## Security

- JWT tokens are required for all protected endpoints
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
- CORS configured for frontend origin

## PDF Generation

The backend includes full PDF generation support:

- **Invoice PDFs**: Generate full invoices with shop details (TAX INVOICE/BILL)
- **Basic Invoice PDFs**: Generate invoices without shop details
- **Challan PDFs**: Generate delivery challans with dimensions only (no prices)

All PDF endpoints support both download and print modes.

## Notes

- Some AI features are simplified and may need full implementation
- Database migrations should be set up for production deployments

## Converting from Spring Boot

This backend maintains the same API structure and endpoints as the original Spring Boot application, ensuring compatibility with the existing React frontend.
